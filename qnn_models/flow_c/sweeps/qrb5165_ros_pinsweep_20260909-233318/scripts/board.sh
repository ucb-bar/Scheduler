# Board discipline for the ROS pinning sweep.
#
# Every board interaction goes through `board_run`: a `timeout -s KILL` around
# an `ssh -n` whose remote command is wrapped in `flock -w 900
# /tmp/qnn_board.lock -c`, because this board is shared with other tenants.
# The lock wait is measured and printed on stderr for every call so a slow run
# can be attributed to contention rather than to the workload.
#
# If the board wedges: on the HOST, `/opt/relay.sh off; sleep 5; /opt/relay.sh
# on`, then wait ~60 s for it to come back.
